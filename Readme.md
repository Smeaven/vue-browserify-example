# Vue.js example setup with Browserify

**Note** This example is now using Vue 0.11.

This example inlines the CSS and HTML template of each component using the `partialify` transform, and inserts the CSS with the `insert-css` module.

## Setup

Watch and auto rebuild with `watchify`:

``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Wouldn't it be nice to write your Vue.js components with its style, template and script all in the same file? Even cooler, how about using your favorite pre-processors together? Check out the [vueify](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify) transform!
